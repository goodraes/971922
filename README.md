　　来时是这条路，归途却非来时路。也许是忘记了，也许是害怕触景生情。有些转身，或是瞬间，也可能是永恒。从前的风情似乎被人偷偷改写了，缘分就这样被遣散了。昨天的多愁善感，成了后来口中常常叨念的纸短情长。往后的路，寂寞成了人生，情路成了枉然。青春，小时光，一切美好，自此，遥不可及。
　　湖上仍旧有很多萎缩的荷叶，大概半折了挂在海面上，大概焉焉的回顾着它们曾有的矗立风度。更多的是绿不绿黄不黄的叶子，记录着这片荷塘已经的安静和灿烂。风过处，即使你承诺闭上眼睛梦想，就当它是一片雨声吧!在陈诉着昨天翠绿的故事。你不许免俗的想起李义山的“留得枯荷听雨声”，暂时的荷与回顾里诗中的荷，合二为一，化为了长久。

When is this road, path way home but not.
May be forgotten, perhaps even fear.
Some turned, or instant, also may be eternal.
Amorous feelings of the former seems to be secretly changed, and thus the fate was disbanded.
Yesterday's sentimental, became short sentiment long mouth is often the case paper.
In the road, lonely life, feeling road became vain.
Youth, hours of light, all good, since then, out of reach.
Still have a lot of atrophy of the lotus leaf on the lake, about half fold and hang on the sea, how about how the review of them had stood manner.
Is more of a green, green, yellow yellow leaves, a record of the lotus pond has been quiet and bright.
Wind, even though you promised to close my eyes and dream, when it is a piece of the rain!
Representation in the green story yesterday.
You are not allowed to avoid custom of Li Yishan "withered lotus listening to the rain" to stay, temporary load and the poem in the review of the Netherlands, two beings become one and long.
